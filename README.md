ðŸš€ Thrilled to share my experience tackling the Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights Data Analysis Project for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge ðŸš€.

Atliq Hardwares, a leading (fictional) Indian computer hardware producer, needed to make faster, data-driven decisions. To expand their data analyst team, they conducted an SQL challenge to assess applicants' technical and soft skills.

Here's what I accomplished:
â€¢	Extracted valuable insights from 1.5 million rows of raw data using data cleansing, transformation, and aggregation techniques.
â€¢	Responded to 10 ad-hoc management requests with insightful SQL queries, providing clear answers to support informed decision-making.
â€¢	Crafted visually compelling reports using Power BI (and a touch of Photoshop magic) to highlight key findings for quick comprehension.
â€¢	Presented insights with clear and concise charts and tables for a user-friendly experience.

My analysis uncovered:
â€¢	Monthly gross sales revenue trends
â€¢	Top-selling products
â€¢	Potential bottlenecks and opportunities for growth

Beyond the numbers:
â€¢	Gathered user feedback and implemented suggestions like improved formatting, UI, and interactivity for a more engaging user experience.

This challenge was an invaluable learning experience, honing my skills in:
â€¢	Data analysis
â€¢	Data visualization
â€¢	Presentation
â€¢	Communication
